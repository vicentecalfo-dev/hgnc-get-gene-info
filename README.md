# HGNC Gene Info Wrapper

This package is designed to facilitate interactions with the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) API. It enables the retrieval of genetic information using specific methods based on stored or searchable fields

### Properties

- `rootURL: string`: Base URL for API requests to HGNC. Default value is 'https://rest.genenames.org'.
- `frontRootURL: string`: Base URL for requests to HGNC Site. Default value is 'https://www.genenames.org'.
- `output: "XML" | "JSON"`: Desired output format for the API responses. Possible values are 'XML' or 'JSON', with 'JSON' being the default.

### Methods

- `fetchInfo()`: Returns general information available from the API.
- `fetchBy(storedField: string, query: any)`: Fetches information from the API based on a specific field and a query. Throws an error if the specified field is not in the `storedFields` list.
- `searchByAllFields(query: any)`: Conducts a search on all searchable fields with the specified query.
- `searchBy(searchableField: string, query: any)`: Conducts a search on a specific field with the specified query. Throws an error if the specified field is not in the `searchableFields` list.
- `dbOverview(dumentType:string)`:  Returns general information from database.

### Accessible Properties

- `storedFields`: Returns a list of fields that can be specified for the `fetchBy` method.
- `searchableFields`: Returns a list of fields that can be specified for the `searchBy` method.
- `documentTypes`: Return s list of fields that can br specified for th `dbOverview` method.

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Instance of the Class

```javascript
const hgnc = new HGNC();
```

### Fetching General Information

The information request (https://rest.genenames.org/info) is utilized to obtain details about the service itself rather than to retrieve data from the server. The response from this request will provide information such as the last update time of the server data (lastModified), the total number of documents (numDoc), which fields are searchable through search and fetch methods (searchableFields), and which fields can be returned by the fetch operation (storedFields).

```javascript
async () => {
  const info = await hgnc.fetchInfo();
};
```

### Fetching by a Specific Field

The fetch request is the primary method used to obtain specific records from the server, which will include all fields listed in the "storedFields" section of the info response. The fetch operation requires the user to specify a queryable field (as detailed in the "searchableFields" section of the info) along with the search term in the URL.

The definition list below shows all the fields that could possibly be returned within a fetch request:

```javascript
async () => {
  const resource = "ensembl_gene_id";
  const query = "ENSG00000166526";
  const data = await hgnc.fetchBy(resource, query);
};
```

### Search

The search request is more powerful than the fetch for querying the database, but the search only returns the fields hgnc_id, symbol, and score. If you want to retrieve all the data for a set of genes from the search results, the user could use the hgnc_id returned by the search to then initiate a request for the hgnc_id using fetch.

Below is a definition list containing the fields that can be used to fetch and search records found within the HGNC record.

#### Searching by All Fields

```javascript
async () => {
  const query = "BRAF";
  const data = await hgnc.searchByAllFields(query);
};
```

#### Searching by a Specific Field

Search can do more powerful request then just a simple look up on a field as seen in the examples below:

| Search example                                                     | Note                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ZNF*`                    | Return all records that have symbols that start with ZNF                                                                             |
| `ZNF?`                    | Return all records that have symbols that start with ZNF and includes an extra character after ZNF (i.e., ZNF3 but not ZNF12)        |
| `:ZNF3`                    | An alternative form of `https://rest.genenames.org/search/symbol/ZNF3`                                                               |
| `:ZNF*+AND+status:Approved`| Return all records that have symbols that start with ZNF which have been approved by the HGNC                                         |
| `:ZNF3+OR+ZNF12`           | Return ZNF3 and ZNF12                                                                                                                |
| `:ZNF*+NOT+status:Approved`| Return all records that have symbols that start with ZNF which are not approved (i.e., entry withdrawn)                               |



```javascript
async () => {
  const resource = "symbol";
  const query = "ZNF*"; // Return all records that have symbols that start with ZNF
  const data = await hgnc.searchBy(resource, query);
};
```


```javascript
async () => {
  const resource = "symbol";
  const query = ":ZNF*+NOT+status:Approved"; // Return all records that have symbols that start with ZNF which are not approved
  const data = await hgnc.searchBy(resource, query);
};
```


### DB Overview

This method returns an overview in numbers of the database data.

```javascript
async () => {
  const documentType = "gene";
  const {response}  = await hgnc.dbOverview(documentType);
};
```
